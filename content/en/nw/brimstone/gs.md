Greatsword is the **highest DPS in-game**, it makes M10 challenging but you can definitely run with Greatsword as your primary weapon.

- In my opinion, Greatsword+Greataxe is the ideal combination - allowing you to group mobs, peel for your healer, and do insane damage.
- Hatchet is still better DPS for groups of mobs, so you could consider running Hatchet and swapping to Greatsword for bosses.

## Perks

### Armour

- <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/perk/perkid_ability_greatsword_combo" target="_blank">Leeching Crosscut</a> on your armour (or weapon) is highly recommended, it allows you to survive through a lot of risky situations.
- <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/perk/perkid_ability_greatsword_burst" target="_blank">Slowing Rupture</a> is not mandatory but the slow can increase your DPS if there are no other slows on the team.
- No other perks are worth using PvE.

### Weapon

The ideal PvE Greatsword is: 
- **Bane**
- Thwarting Strikes > Trenchant Crits > Trenchant Strikes > Rogue > Enchanted > Vicious
- Keenly Empowered = Elemental Chain(mob weakness) > Attunement

## Skill Trees 


### DPS

Spin to win. This build puts you at empower cap and is the highest DPS, but leaves you extremely vulnerable.

- Open with Relentless Rush -> Skyward -> Crosscut and spam heavies.

### Utility 

This tree provides a lot of utility for your team, and is only marginally less DPS (depending on if your healer is using Oblivion or not).

- Open with Rupture for weaken/fortify, follow up with Skyward to apply rend/disease/stance swap, then Crosscut into charged heavy attacks.
- Skyward can be swapped with Relentless Rush, depending on your needs.
- The pull from Rupture can be extremely useful for peeling mobs, if you need it then open with either Crosscut or Skyward first, then use Rupture for the pull before using your last ability to stance swap.

### Tank

This tree enables you to use Greatsword, combined with dodging to tank. Pair it with a Hatchet in light/medium armour, or a Sword and Shield at any weight.

- Steadfast Strike can be swapped with any ability in the Onslaught Tree.
