## Armour Gems
The ideal (& affordable) gem loadout is 28.1% Elemental (3 Mutation-Specific Gems + Amulet or Shield Protection) & 10% Physical (5 Runeglass Onyx) Resistance. 

- We recommend <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_gem_opal_melee" target="_blank">Runeglass of Punishing Opal</a> for your armour.

The most consistent setup is running 58.1% mutation-specific resistance. This is only attainable with 8x mutation-specific gems, and amulet or shield protection. This setup is no longer practical due to the cost of swapping Runeglass Gems.

The majority of damage in mutations is elemental, so in order to perform consistently it's important to have a high base resistance against the mutation. 

See [here](/nw/info/dmgabs) for more information about damage absorption.

## Weapon Gems
### DPS
This is currently out of date, will be updated within 24hrs to display which is best.


The ideal weapon gem for each build is listed alongside that build.

For all DPS it's ideal to use a Cut Pristine Opal **or** Diamond **unless** the following is true:


```
(30% - WPN%)/2 >= 15%
```
- 30% = The maximum % bonus any elemental type will do.
- WPN% = The % bonus your weapon does against the mobtype. [Found here](/nw/info/mobresists/)
- Divide by 2 as elemental gems convert half of your damage.
  
examples:

-- Hatchet vs Angry Earth = (30% - 20%)/2 = 5% (This is why Opal is better than Ruby for Genesis.)

-- Spear vs. Ancients = (30% - 0%)/2 = 15% (Topaz is worth using for the consistent uptime)

### Healer
Healers should have a Cut Pristine Diamond in their Lifestaff, and a mobtype weakness gem in their Void Gauntlet.

---

### Tank
Tanks should be using a Cut Pristine Carnelian in **both** weapons.

- Alternatively, DPS Tanks can use <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/perk/perkid_earring_threatadd" target="_blank">Despised</a> on their Earring while using the same gems as a DPS. You lose your taunts, but as long as you attack you will hold aggro (Not viable for The Depths).
