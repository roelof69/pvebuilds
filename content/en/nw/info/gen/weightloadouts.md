Assuming **everyone has 5x ward on their armour**, you should ALWAYS be using light armour.

- **DPS** should be light, 5-200CON depending on experience.
- **Tank** can be heavy, though medium/light hybrid-tank works well. It's hard to determine whether Leadership or another DPS is more beneficial to the party.
- **Healer** needs to be in light to avoid healing penalties.

- If you get destroyed, just spec 200CON
