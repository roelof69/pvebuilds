## Armour Gems
For public runs, we recommend to continue using Cut Pristine Mutation-Specific gems. There is no reason to pay the price of runeglass casing for public runs.


- The most consistent setup is running 58.1% mutation-specific resistance, attainable with 8x mutation-specific gems.

The majority of damage in mutations is elemental, so in order to perform consistently it's important to have a high base resistance against the mutation. 

For speedrunning we recommend <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_gem_onyx_melee" target="_blank">Runeglass of Punishing Onyx</a> for your armour, however this setup makes you completely reliant on your healer. **Do not attempt to run this in publics, unless you know the healer is good.**

See [here](/nw/info/pve/dmgabs) for more information about damage absorption.

## Weapon Gems
### DPS

Diamond or Opal are the **best to slot in all weapons, in all expeditions.** 

- The 50 & 100 Strength attribute perks, as well as Slash Damage on ring **only apply to physical damage**. This means if you use a conversion gem you cut these bonuses in half.
- Diamond/Opal needs to have an uptime of 50% for it to be the best option - if for some reason you feel like you aren't meeting this check, consider swapping back to an elemental gem for consistency.

#### Runeglass Casings

Typically not recommended, unless you're in a coordinated team. However, they are a slight DPS increase on all weapons, **as long as you're the only one using it in the party.**

- The DoT's status effect is based on the Runeglass casings element.
- (<a href="https://nwdb.info/db/status-effect/status_perk_runeglass_attunement_lightningdmg" target="_blank">Surge</a> for <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_case_empty_lightning" target="_blank">Electrified</a>, <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/status-effect/status_perk_runeglass_attunement_arcanedmg" target="_blank">Hex</a> for <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_case_empty_arcane" target="_blank">Empowering</a>, <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/status-effect/status_perk_runeglass_attunement_firedmg" target="_blank">Burn</a> for <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_case_empty_fire" target="_blank">Igniting</a>, <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/status-effect/status_perk_runeglass_attunement_naturedmg" target="_blank">Poison</a> for <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_case_empty_nature" target="_blank">Nature</a>)
- Each of these can only be applied once per mob.
- A coordinate team should run three different types between their players, to ensure everyone benefits from the 8% (or more from scaling) DoT.



<!-- ```
(30% - WPN%)/2 >= 20%
```
- 30% = The maximum % bonus any elemental type will do.
- WPN% = The % bonus your weapon does against the mobtype. [Found here](/nw/info/pve/mobresists/)
- Divide by 2 as elemental gems convert half of your damage.

### Healer
Healers should have a Cut Pristine Diamond in their Lifestaff, and a mobtype weakness gem in their Void Gauntlet.

### Tank
Tanks should be using a Cut Pristine Carnelian in **both** weapons.

- Alternatively, DPS Tanks can use <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/perk/perkid_earring_threatadd" target="_blank">Despised</a> on their Earring while using the same gems as a DPS. You lose your taunts, but as long as you attack you will hold aggro (Not viable for The Depths).
