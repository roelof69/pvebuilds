## Armour Gems
**What gems should I have on my armour?**

- For **Runeglass Gems** use  <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_case_empty_melee" target="_blank">Runeglass of Punishing</a>

### Open World

The majority of damage in the open world is Physical, making Cut Pristine Onyxes the ideal choice. If you're doing chest runs then use Pristine Pearls.

---

### Mutations

It depends on the [mutation](/nw/info/mut/modifiers/), but we recommend using 8x of the below gems with an elemental protection amulet.

-- Void (Eternal): <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/amethystcutt4" target="_blank">Cut Pristine Amethyst</a>

-- Fire (Hellfire): <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/rubycutt4" target="_blank">Cut Pristine Ruby</a>

-- Eternal (Nature): <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/ambercutt4" target="_blank">Cut Pristine Amber</a>

-- Icebound (Ice): <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/aquamarinecutt4" target="_blank">Cut Pristine Aquamarine</a>
 
- If you aren't above 50% resistance from your gems (7x gems + protection perk), your ideal gem combination depends on the amount of fortify you're applying, [see here for an explanation.](/nw/info/mut/gemchoices/)
