## Armour Gems
For public runs, we recommend to continue using Cut Pristine Mutation-Specific gems. There is no reason to pay the price of runeglass casing for public runs.


- The most consistent setup is running 58.1% mutation-specific resistance, attainable with 8x mutation-specific gems.

The majority of damage in mutations is elemental, so in order to perform consistently it's important to have a high base resistance against the mutation. 

For speedrunning we recommend <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/item/runeglass_gem_onyx_melee" target="_blank">Runeglass of Punishing Onyx</a> for your armour, however this setup makes you completely reliant on your healer. **Do not attempt to run this in publics, unless you know the healer is good.**

See [here](/nw/info/dmgabs) for more information about damage absorption.

## Weapon Gems
### DPS

Even after the release of Brimstone, we believe that Cut Pristine Opal and Diamond are still the best to slot in **all weapons**.

- The new gems cost quite a lot, and you **lose** damage on a lot of hits with them (15% normal opal, 12% runeglass)
- We use an Opal or Diamond because of the 50/100STR perks, and slashdamage on ring. These bonuses **only apply to physical damage**, so if you use a conversion gem you lose some of these bonuses.
  
It may be worth using Runeglass gems on slow attacking weapons: Greatsword, Greataxe, and Sword.




<!-- ```
(30% - WPN%)/2 >= 20%
```
- 30% = The maximum % bonus any elemental type will do.
- WPN% = The % bonus your weapon does against the mobtype. [Found here](/nw/info/mobresists/)
- Divide by 2 as elemental gems convert half of your damage.

### Healer
Healers should have a Cut Pristine Diamond in their Lifestaff, and a mobtype weakness gem in their Void Gauntlet.

---

### Tank
Tanks should be using a Cut Pristine Carnelian in **both** weapons.

- Alternatively, DPS Tanks can use <a href="https://nwdb.info/db/perk/perkid_earring_threatadd" target="_blank">Despised</a> on their Earring while using the same gems as a DPS. You lose your taunts, but as long as you attack you will hold aggro (Not viable for The Depths).
